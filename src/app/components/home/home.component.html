      <p class="lead">Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
        And you never had a chance
        Love it, or leave it, you can't understand
        A pretty face, but you do so carry on
        And on
        And on</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">
          I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
          I'm just the way that the doctor made me, on
          And on
          And on
          And on
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Love is the red of the rose on your coffin door
          What's life like, bleeding on the floor
          The floor
          The floor
        </p>
          <p class="lead"> 
            You'll never make me leave
            I wear this on my sleeve
            Give me a reason to believe
          </p>
          <p class="lead">

            So give me all your poison
            And give me all your pills
            And give me all your hopeless hearts
            And make me ill
            You're running after something
            That you'll never kill
            If this is what you want
            Then fire at will
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Preach all you want but who's gonna save me?
            I keep a gun on the book you gave me,â€¦
